Coffee shop website using HTML/JavaScript/CSS/PHP

I designed and developed a dynamic coffee shop website from scratch, incorporating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP technologies. 
This project reflects my expertise in front-end and back-end web development. 
The website features an intuitive user interface, responsive design, and interactive elements powered by JavaScript. 
Additionally, I implemented PHP for server-side scripting, enabling functionalities such as user authentication, order processing, and dynamic content management. 
Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to create visually appealing and functional web applications, emphasizing my skills in both client-side and server-side programming. 
This hands-on experience showcases my versatility and proficiency in web development, providing visitors with a seamless and enjoyable online coffee shop experience.
